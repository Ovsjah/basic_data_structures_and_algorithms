The project has my implementation of binary tree with breadth first search, depth first search and recursive depth first search functions also the project has n_ary tree with breadth first search algorithm for finding the shortest path for the knight on the chess board.

Achievements:

1. Binary Tree
2. BFS
3. DFS
4. RecDFS
5. N_ary Tree with BFS route searching
